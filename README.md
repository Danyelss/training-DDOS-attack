Git is a mature, actively maintained open source project originally developed in 2005 by Linus Torvalds, the famous creator of the Linux operating system kernel. 
A staggering number of software projects rely on Git for version control, including commercial projects as well as open source. 
Having a distributed architecture, Git is an example of a DVCS (hence Distributed Version Control System). 
Rather than have only one single place for the full version history of the software as is common in once-popular version control systems like CVS or Subversion (also known as SVN), in Git, every developer's working copy of the code is also a repository that can contain the full history of all changes.
Git has been designed with the integrity of managed source code as a top priority. 
The content of the files as well as the true relationships between files and directories, versions, tags and commits, all of these objects in the Git repository are secured with a cryptographically secure hashing algorithm called SHA1.
This protects the code and the change history against both accidental and malicious change and ensures that the history is fully traceable.
